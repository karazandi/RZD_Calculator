# RZD_Calculator
This is an ongoing development of a private project to build a simple calculator app that is capable of doing pipeline engineering calculations and simple assessment/analysis using python programming language with the help of built in python GUI Tkinter. I hope the beta version will be available soon enough. Beta version will cover onshore pipe support spacing calculator, onshore pipeline road crossing assessment, onshore pipeline wall thickness calculator, and offshore pipeline wall thickness calculator
