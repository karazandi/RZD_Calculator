# RZD_Calculator
This is an ongoing development of a private project to build a simple calculator app that is capable of doing pipeline engineering calculations and simple assessment/analysis using python programming language with the help of built in python GUI Tkinter. This calculator project is intended to provide easy access for quick calculation during engineering discussion without any hasle of opening engineering spreadsheets. <br/>
I hope the beta version will be available soon enough. Beta version will cover onshore pipe support spacing calculator, onshore pipeline road crossing assessment, onshore pipeline wall thickness calculator, and onshore pipe/pipeline expansion loop calculator. <br/>
## To be able to run the calculator app properly, please follow these instructions <br/>
1. Install Python from (https://www.python.org/downloads/) <br/>
2. Install Pycharm from (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) <br/>
3. Install Pillow extension after installing python using command prompt ***pip install Pillow*** <br/>
4. Download and extract **PIL.rar** and **Images.rar** from my repository to the same folder of python installation <br/>
5. Copy source code and run using pycharm
