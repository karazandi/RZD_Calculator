# RZD_Calculator
This is an ongoing development of a private project to build a simple calculator app that is capable of doing pipeline engineering calculations and simple assessment/analysis using python programming language with the help of built in python GUI Tkinter. I hope the beta version will be available soon enough. Beta version will cover onshore pipe support spacing calculator, onshore pipeline road crossing assessment, onshore pipeline wall thickness calculator, and offshore pipeline wall thickness calculator. <br/>
RZD_Calc_V1.00.01.py file is the first upload for calculator apps source code. It contains only 50% of the planned progression for the beta version. For now, this calculator app only works for onshore pipe support spacing calculator and onshore pipeline road crossing assessment. For both onshore and offshore pipeline wall thickness calcuator is still under development. <br/>
## To be able to run the calculator app properly, please follow the following instructions <br/>
1. Install Python from (https://www.python.org/downloads/) <br/>
2. Install Pycharm from (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) <br/>
3. Install Pillow extension using command prompt after installed python using command prompt ***pip install Pillow*** <br/>
4. Download and extract PIL folder from my repository to the same folder of python installation <br/>
5. Copy source code and run using pycharm
